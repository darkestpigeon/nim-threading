# threading

New threading primitives for Nim's `arc`/`orc` memory management modes: atomics, channels, smart pointers and wait groups.

## Documentation

> These modules require `--threads:on`, and one of the `--mm:arc`, `--mm:orc` or `--mm:atomicArc` compilation flags!

Documentation: https://nim-lang.github.io/threading

See [tests/](./tests/) for some usage examples.
